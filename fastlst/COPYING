This archive contains the source files for FastLst.

Since I have no more time to develop this program,
I am releasing this archive so that other people can
fix problems and maybe develop new features.

Effective today, no registration is required for
the use of the program, although possible donations
will not be returned.

Anyone is free to use and modify the source files
contained in this archive provided that:

1) the original copyright is retained
2) the code is used for new versions of this program only
