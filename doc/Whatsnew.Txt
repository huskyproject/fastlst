                         Changes and Additions


        2.03   Conversion to Linux by Per Lundberg (see AUTHORS), 
               January 03 2001.
        

        2.02   License Change, March 20 1999
               Alberto Pasquale has released the sourcecode for
               fastlst and the needed libraries. 
               See fastlst/COPYING or aplibs/COPYING for license details.
        
        
        2.01   Public Release, October 29th 1997
        
              - Support for the new method of listing IP addresses in
                the Zone 2 Fidonet nodelist.
        
                Example:
        
                a phone of "000-194-155-233-455"
                is changed to  "194.155.233.455".
        
                Then any switch-based phone translation is operated,
                just as if the nodelist contained "194.155.233.455".
        
        
              - Support for environment variables in the configuration
                file.
        
                If a '%' is followed by 2 or more characters (different
                from '%' and ' '), it is considered as an environment
                variable and substituted with the corresponding value.
        
                The variable name is terminated by space or another '%'.
        
                Environment variable may also be nested.
        
                To specify a '%' character, write two of them "%%".
        
                Example:
        
                in your environment there is "BBSPATH=d:\bbs\";
        
                you can the use this variable in FastLst.Cfg:
        
                StatusLog %BBSPATH%log\fastlst.log
        
        
        2.00   Public Release, June 19th 1997
        
              - WARNING: this is not a Drop-In replacement.
                Some statements have been dropped.
        
           New Features
        
              - Support for new V7+ nodelist format, via the "Version7+"
                statement.
        
                To enable V7+, just use "Version7+" in the place of
                "Version7".
        
                Version7+ <path> <nodex> [<sysop>[.<ext>]]
        
                Examples:
        
                Version7+ \bbs\v7 NODEX SYSOP
                Version7+ \bbs\v7 NODEX
        
                If SysOp is not specified, <NODEX>.SDX is assumed.
        
                Generated files:
        
                <nodex>.DAT
                <nodex>.NDX
                <nodex>.DTP V7+ data file
                <nodex>.PDX Phone Index
                <nodex>.SDX or as specified by <sysop>
        
        
              - The DTP file is linked "in memory" by default.
                Since this can be a quite memory hungry task, FastLst
                will automatically revert to "On Disk" linking mode if
                there is not sufficient memory.
        
        
              - New LinkOnDisk statement (after Version7) to make
                FastLst link the DTP file using Disk instead of memory.
        
                Version7+ \bbs\v7 NODEX
                  LinkOnDisk
        
        
              - New errolevel 17 "Error Linking"
        
        
              - Additional arguments for "Nodelist" statement:
                Nodelist <list> [PartAddr [<region> [<hub>]]]
        
                Since FastLst links the "fidonet" hierarchy, it is
                important to specify region and hub when the nodelist
                segment does not contain this type of information.
        
        
              - Additional arguments for the "NODE" keyword:
        
                Node,<4Daddr>[ <region>[ <hub>]],...
        
        
              - It is now possible to assign call and user costs
                depending on modem type for Verbatim phone numbers.
        
                In the Typedef lines you can configure the costs:
        
                Typedef
                    [...]
                    VMODEM 200 100 0
                    [...]
                End
        
                The call cost is 100, the user cost is 0.
        
        
              - It is now possible to configure special dial
                translations for non-PSTN "phone numbers" that FastLst
                takes "verbatim" by default.
        
                These dial translations DO NOT affect the indexed entry
                (in <NODEX>.PDX) and are intended as a work around for
                the dial translations operated by the mailer program.
        
                The syntax requires a set of strings to be put on the
                Typedef line that defines the affected "Modem Flag".
        
                The first character of each string will be substituted
                with the remaining characters.
        
                A string containing space MUST be included in quotation
                marks. If the quotation mark is needed inside the quoted
                string, it must be double.
        
                15 strings of 5 characters are allowed.
        
                ATTENTION: This feature is only available in normal (non
                BitType) mode.
        
                Example:
        
                You need to translate '.' to '*', ':' to ' ', 'v' to
                'V'; call_cost=100, user_cost=0:
        
                Typedef
                  [...]
                  VMODEM 200 100 0 .* ": " vV
                  [...]
                End
        
                You want to translate '.' to '\.', ':' to ' ', 'v' to
                'V'; call_cost=150, user_cost=100:
        
                Typedef
                  [...]
                  VMODEM 200 150 100 .\. ": " vV
                  [...]
                End
        
        
                Recommended dial translations for Binkley and VMODEM:
        
                -\- .* vV ~\~ ": "
        
        
              - New "digital" costs.
                For people who want to differentiate analog and digital
                costs.
        
                In the Dial or Cost table you can indicate 2 more
                fields; let's consider a Dial-table line
        
                Prefix New     Call   User Comment
                to     Prefix  Cost   Cost
                match
        
                43     0043-   4      0    ; Austria
        
                If you do not define the optional new fields, the
                indicated costs are for both analog and digital.
        
        
        
                43     0043-   4      0    8    0  ; Austria
        
                In this line:
                Analog  Call cost = 4
                Analog  User cost = 0
                Digital Call cost = 8
                Digital User cost = 0
        
                If the Digital User cost is omitted, it is taken equal
                to the Digital Call one.
        
        
                How can FastLst know about digital calls ?
        
                A new parameter is available in Typedef:
        
                Typedef
                  X75  1 DIGITAL            ; X75  digital PSTN
                  V120 2 DIGITAL            ; V120 digital PSTN
                  V34  3 ANALOG             ; V34  analog  PSTN
                  V32  4                    ; V32  analog  PSTN
                  VM   5 5 0 .* vV ": "     ; VMODEM with costs and dial
                                            ; translations
                End
        
        
                The ANALOG specification is optional.
        
        
              - Multiple PasswordFile statements now allowed without
                restrictions.
        
        
              - New statement "Include <filename>" to allow inclusion of
                files in FastLst's configuration.
        
        
              - New statement: NoPointLstPhone.
                Can be used in Input, Output or Global blocks.
                It is useful when you want to _remove_ the phone numbers
                specified in the PointLists (German or "Boss" styles)
                and change them to "-Unpublished-".
        
                If you use Squish and Binkley, you usually will like
                pointlists with the Boss' phone in the point entries
                (otherwise a crash message to a point will have to be
                manually readdressed to its Boss).
        
                But if you use a netmail manager (as NmFwd) that already
                routes the crash messages for points that do not have a
                phone to their Boss, then you will probably like this
                statement.
        
        
              - New statement: LogStats.
                Can be used in the output section of an output block.
                It makes FastLst output the statistics for the (output)
                nodelist to MsgLogArea.
        
                Example:
        
                Version7...
                  LogStats
        
           Dropped Support
        
              - Dos 16 bit version dropped.
        
                The 32 bit version has the following memory
                requirements: 100K of base memory, 7MB of DPMI for 60000
                nodes.
        
              - Now indices are always processed in memory: dropped
                "FileMode" and "TmpPath" configuration statements and
                "-t" command line switch.
        
              - Dropped support for SysOpLst, SysDup and IncSysOp
                configuration statements: the SysOp index will always
                contain all the entries that are compiled to
                <nodex>.DAT.
        
              - Dropped NoDash keyword: no use.
        
              - The '#' does not mean "take the phone verbatim" anymore.
                Now any phone containing non-numeric characters is taken
                verbatim.
        
              - Dropped support for stripping flags in Dial/Cost table.
        
              - ATTENTION: The "separate Cost Table" and the "BitType"
                options are still supported in this version of FastLst
                but are considered obsolete and their support will be
                dropped in the future.
        
        
          Changed Behaviour
        
              - When a timeout happens accessing the BSY semaphore,
                FastLst now proceeds with the following "Output Block"
                (previously it aborted).
        
              - In the case FastLst terminates with errorlevel 12 or 14,
                next time it will retry compilation, as expected
                (previously it had to be forced with -f in case of
                errorlevel 12).
        
          Bug Fixes
        
              - When Version7 specified a path containing the '.'
                character, FastLst didn't add the default ".NDX"
                extension to the SysOp index filename.
                Fixed.
        
        
        1.36   Public Release, July 18th 1996
        
              - "LocalValues" can now be used multiple times for
                users at the crossroads of multiple area codes.
                See the docs under "Dial Table".
        
              - The "Phone" statement has been extended to:
        
                Phone <Addr> [#]<Phone> [<NodeFlags> [<Cost> [<UCost>]]]
        
              - Phone specifications starting with '#' are taken
                verbatim (no dial translation, no cost look-up); this
                may be handy for internet addresses and script names.
        
              - New statement "CostVerbatimPhone <cost> <ucost>" to
                specify default costs for "verbatim" phone
                specifications.
        
        
        
        1.34   Public Release, July 1st 1996
        
             - OS/2: New statement "ArcDate Write|Creation" to choose
               which date must be used by FastLst to compute the age
               of archived nodelist files, defaults to Creation,
               ignored by non-OS2 versions.
        
             - New errorlevel 16: nothing found after unarchiving a
               fixed-name nodelist.
        
             - When dealing with fixed-name nodelists, FastLst now
               always sets the archive date to the same value of the
               included file.
        
             - Under certain conditions the old versions of FastLst
               might re-archive the original nodelist file, so that
               it may fail TIC CRC-check when forwarded.
        
               The problem arises when the following conditions are
               satisfied at the same time:
               - new nodelist archive file
               - new configuration
               - zipmethod includes the original archive type
        
             - Improved documentation.
        
        
        
        1.33
             - OS/2: Version 1.32 invoked the command processor when
               executing external commands with no .exe or .com
               extension specified, instead of trying to load the
               executable directly.
        
               This was due to an overlook of the DosExecPgm OS/2 API,
               used to improve compatibility in the case of substitution
               parameters containing "special" OS/2 characters.
        
               Now FastLst tries to load the command as specified, then
               it tries with .COM extension appended, in the end with
               .EXE.
        
        
        
        1.32
             - New "MultiLineDesc <nnn> [<c>]" statement for enabling
               Multi-Line description support.
        
             - New "FlagDef" table to associate nodelist flags to user
               defined bits.
        
             - In "Version7 <path> <Nodex> <SysopNdx>" you can now
               specify an extension for <SysopNdx>.
               If no extension is specified, ".NDX" is assumed if
               <SysopNdx> is different from <Nodex>, otherwise the
               ".SDX" extension is used.
        
             - New <nodex>.BSY V7 semaphore to avoid concurrent access
               to nodelist files during compilation.
        
             - New errorlevel 14 exit on timeout on V7 semaphore.
        
             - The "MsgRem" used alone, will report all comment lines,
               excluding the empty ones.
        
             - Use of "Phone <addr> <newnumber>" for scripts and
               internet addresses (not new, just explained):
        
                 Examples:
        
                My country code is 39 (Italy) and the area code is 59
                (Modena):

             - Some configuration errors better flagged.
        
             - V7 packing algorithm improved in speed.
        
             - Dropped OS/2 16 bit version
        
             - New NT version. Unfortunately it doesn't work under W95
               (the external commands seem not to work so that nodelists
               can't be packed/unpacked. Maybe when I will upgrade the
               Watcom compiler, I will support W95 too.
        
             - New icon FastLst2.Ico for OS/2.
        
             - New Registration sites.
        
        
        
        1.31
             - New "CostNullPhone <cost> [<ucost>]" global keyword, to
               allow the specification of costs to be assigned to nodes
               with empty (unpublished, etc.) phone number.
        
               <ucost> defaults to <cost>.
        
               If CostNullPhone is not used, <cost> defaults to 65535
               and <ucost> to 0.
        
               Example:
        
                        CostNullPhone 1000 0
        
               Some programs might have bugs that cause problems dealing
               with high costs (such as the default 65535). Should you
               experience problems with entries that have a "NullPhone",
               try setting a lower cost e.g. "CostNullPhone 900 0".
        
             - Before applying a diff, the CRC of the OLD nodelist (as
               reported in its first line) is compared to the one
               reported in the diff file. Previously this check was not
               done, so in the remote case you were applying a diff to
               an illegal nodelist (e.g. a european diff to an american
               nodelist), the error was discovered only at the end of
               the application, when checking the CRC of the resulting
               nodelist.
        
             - Checks added to warn about illegal empty Cost or Dial
               tables. Previously the program hanged.
        
             - No more Access Violations when "ArcDiff" is used without
               "NodeDiff" (it is a strange configuration, but it is now
               legal).
        
             - Fixed bug that caused access violation applying a
               nodediff when using "NodeDiff" without "ArcDiff" (anyway
               you are encouraged letting FastLst do all the work it is
               designed for...).
        
             - The number of archived nodelists to be kept (as specified
               in the ArcList statement) is now checked a second time
               after nodediff application, so that the required number
               of archives is kept exactly. Previously, after nodediff
               application, there was one archive more than specified.
        
             - When specifying <ArcKeep> 0 in "ArcList", the nodelist is
               not archived (previously was archived and then deleted).
        
             - Changed Compress.Cfg to support the OS/2 RAR.
        
             - Dos versions are now distributed with the same executable
               names as the OS/2 versions: FASTLST.EXE (32 bit) and
               FASTL16.EXE (16 bit).
        
        
        
        1.30
             - WARNING: FastLst v 1.30 is NOT a true "Drop In"
               replacement for v 1.20, anyway there is little to change:
        
               - Add a "CompressCfg <squish_compress_cfg_file>" line to
                 the "Global Info" section of your fastlst.cfg.
        
               - Remove all "Arc" and "UnArc" lines.
        
               - In each "Input block" section where you would like to
                 be able to compress new nodelists (e.g. where Nodediffs
                 are processed and you were using "Arc" statements), add
                 one or more "ArcMethod <meth>,[<f>] ..." lines, where
                 <meth> represents one of the archiving methods defined
                 in <squish_compress_cfg_file> (e.g. ZIP, LH, etc.) and
                 the optional <f> is an override for the initial
                 character of the archived file extension (in the case
                 it is named after the day of the year and you do not
                 want to use the first character of the default
                 extension, as defined in <squish_compress_cfg_file>).
        
               - See FastLst.Doc for more information.
        
        
             - DOS: There is a new 32 bit version with the DOS4GW
               extender.
        
             - OS/2: There is a new 16 bit version for those who still
               use OS/2 1.3.
        
             - OS/2 32: the "Priority" statement can be used to change
               the priority for the FastLst process.
        
             - The 32 bit versions can now be configured to use the
               temporary file instead of working in memory.
               The "FileMode" statement and the "-t" command line switch
               are used for selecting the mode.
        
             - The routines used in 32 bit versions for "in memory" work
               (no temporary file) have been completely rewritten in
               order to need far less memory. This way, the 32 bit
               versions usually allocate about 1/4 of the memory they
               needed with v 1.20. This is an important issue on systems
               with not too much physical RAM (especially for the DOS
               version, that cannot efficiently use virtual memory), but
               the benefits are noticeable even on systems with plenty
               of RAM (less OS/2 swap reorganization when FastLst ends).
        
             - The "TmpPath" config statement is no longer needed:
               FastLst will use the TMP or TEMP environment variable if
               no TmpPath statement is used.
        
             - If you want FastLst to kill all uncompressed nodelist
               (except for those that are not stored in compressed
               format too), just add a "KillSource" line to the "Global
               Info" section of FastLst.cfg.
        
             - All the ArcList and Arcdiff statements can now work
               WITHOUT the specification of the first letter of the
               extension, i.e. "ArcList NodeList.z??" can be changed to
               "ArcList NodeList.???" and "ArcDiff NodeDiff.z??" can be
               changed to "ArcDiff NodeDiff.???". This way FastLst will
               automatically handle any archive type that shows up in
               the ArcList directory.
        
             - Now all the nodelists and nodediffs can be maintained in
               many different archived formats. The archiving method for
               NodeDiffs must be specified using "ArcDiffMethod
               <meth>,[<f>] ...".
        
             - The "block" structure of the config file remains, but it
               becomes a lot more flexible: the majority of config verbs
               can now be anywhere in the config file, but they have
               effect on different nodelists depending on their position
               in the cfg. E.G.: "PasswordFile", being an address
               related verb, can be both in the "Output Nodelist" and
               "Input Nodelist" sections. If you use it after "Version7"
               but before the first "NodeList", then it will be used for
               all the NodeLists of that "Output block". If you use it
               after a "NodeList", it will be used (as in the past) for
               that Nodelist only. Other non-address related verbs (e.g.
               ArcMethod) can be everywhere (global, output nodelist,
               input nodelist) and the will affect the operations
               depending on their position (global: all the nodelists;
               output: all the nodelist in the current output block;
               input: the current nodelist only).
        
             - "NoRedir" verb: the nodes that should be redirected will
               acquire the empty string as phone number, so that you
               will never call a system different from that you think
               you are calling.
        
             - Many new verbs have been added to support external
               operations; the names are self explaining:
        
        
               BeforeArcList
               AfterArcList
               BeforeUnArcList
               AfterUnArcList
               BeforeUnArcDiff
               AfterUnArcDiff
               BeforeArcDiff
               AfterArcDiff
        
               All the preceding verbs support the %a (complete archive
               name) and %f (add/extract file name, no path) parameters.
        
        
               BeforeEdit
               AfterEdit
        
               The preceding verbs support the %l and %d parameters
               standing for the full pathnames of the NodeList and
               NodeDiff files.
        
        
               BeforeCompile
               AfterCompile
        
               The preceding verbs support the %l parameter only.
        
        
               BeforeKillSource
        
               The preceding verb does not support any parameter.
               It is executed even if "KillSource" is not used.
               It is a means to invoke a command before FastLst ends.
               The "NeededBeforeKill" verb must be used to specify the
               NodeLists needed by this command.
        
               See FastLst.Doc for more information.
        
             - A new cfg section is now available: "NoCompile".
               It is a means for maintaining a NodeList (applying
               nodediffs, archiving with different archivers etc.)
               without compiling it.
        
             - The 3D German PointListst is now internally supported by
               FastLst. Just use the "GermanPointList" verb in the
               pertaining block.
        
             - When all goes well, FastLst exists with errorlevel 0 if
               it has compiled something, 100 if nothing new to compile
               was found.
        
             - New method for evaluating the age of a variable extension
               arcfile: the file date is considered in addition to the 2
               digits in the extension. This way you can keep a greater
               number of old files without creating problems to fastlst,
               even at the year crossing.
        
             - File descriptions in FILES.BBS are now maintained
               (deleted or added). New statements are available:
        
               ArcListDesc <description>
               ArcDiffDesc <description>
        
               <description> can contain the following parameters:
        
               %d day
               %a archiver
               %D date, USA format
               %L Local date
        
             - The dash is now recognized as insignificant while doing
               the Dial and Cost translations.
        
             - The line # is specified when reporting a config error.
        
             - Some information about the compilation can now be
               reported to a fido/squish message area: see FastLst.Doc
               for a description for "MsgLogArea", "MsgRemArea" and
               related statements.
        
             - FastLst is now multitasking smarter: e.g. it retries for
               15s when it has to delete the old compiled nodelists and
               rename the new ones.
        
             - New Export capability: FastLst is now able to "export"
               segments of nodelist: see the "Export" section in the
               docs.
        
             - The Dial and Cost tables can be unified: the old syntax
               is still supported, but a new way can be used for cost
               and dial specifications. I think that Europeans can
               continue using the old syntax (if they like), while the
               Americans should appreciate the new way (due to the
               complex dial translations needed).
        
             - Fixed bug that caused access violations when no
               "StatusLog" was used.
        
        
        
        1.20
             - WARNING: FastLst v 1.20 is NOT a "Drop In" replacement
               for previous versions; you MUST modify the config file
               following the comments in it before using this version.
        
             - In order to make available new powerful options without
               using clumsy syntax and risking subtle side effects and
               strange interactions, some obsolete features have been
               dropped and the methods to specify the files to be
               compiled have been modified.
        
             - FastLst is faster than ever: on my system and with my
               configuration, the OS/2 version is about 25% faster
               than v 1.16.
               If you time it, be aware that the OS/2 version optimizes
               memory allocation (and speed) basing on the needs of the
               previous compilation, so it is usually a bit slower on
               the first run with a new cfg.
        
             - The ancient "Version6" nodelist support has been
               dropped. However the sometime-useful fidouser.lst is
               still available.
        
             - The "MergeList" and "Kill999" options have been dropped.
               With version7 you can simply compile segments after the
               full list, since updated entries are put in the indices
               in the place of old ones.
        
             - Added support for compiling multiple V7 nodelists
               with different output names.
        
             - Added support for automatic decompression of
               nodelists and nodediffs: no more complex batch files.
        
             - Now FastLst compiles an output nodelist only if some
               of its input lists are new: the -f command line switch
               has been added to force compilation.
        
             - Pay Attention: version 1.14 introduced a new behaviour
               in generating V7 indices to circumvent a bug in
               Binkley 2.50 V7 search function.
               Now Binkley 2.58 should have fixed the bug, so
               FastLst goes back to the "correct" V7 index.
               A new cfg option has been added to keep using the
               "bug-circumvent" index form: see "V7BugFix" in the
               example config file.
        
               *******************************************************
               * If you are using an older Binkley or some program   *
               * that have got inspiration from Binkley 2.50 sources,*
               * you could experience "address not found" problems,  *
               * unless you explicitly activate the "V7BugFix"       *
               * option in fastlst.cfg.                              *
               *******************************************************
        
             - The "KillOld" and "AutoErase" verbs have been dropped.
               Old nodelist and nodediff files are always erased.
               You can control how many archived files are to be kept
               via the new archive processing verbs.
        
             - The -o -s -l -g -m -p -b command line switches have
               been dropped since they are now useless.
        
             - The "include" cfg keyword and the -i command line
               switch have been dropped.
               You can still include lists of passwords in a separate
               file via the "PasswordFile" cfg keyword, that allows
               to optionally omit the "Password" keyword in front of
               each password specification.
        
             - Due to the frequent misunderstanding of the real meaning
               and function of the "Address" config option, I have
               decided to drop it.
               These days it is not much useful (in a nodelist
               compiler), since many systems have various different
               addresses and we are used to write addresses in the full
               4D format to avoid ambiguities.
               In the various config options that require an address
               or a part of it, you now need to specify all the
               required fields, always starting with the zone number:
               no assumption is made on your zone/net/node.
        
             - The obsolete "MaxBaud" and "Baud" verb have been dropped.
               Should you use an old 2400 non error-correcting
               modem that needs equal DTE and DCE rates, make sure
               your front-end is configured to dial using its own
               max baud rate instead of the baud rate reported by
               the nodelist for the callee (AutoBaud in Binkley.cfg).
        
             - The "Country" and "UCost" verbs have been dropped,
               the "Dial" and "Cost" tables have been slightly modified
               to specify domestic and international defaults in a more
               coherent manner and to include "UCost" info.
        
             - The "TypeExact" verb has been substituted by the
               complementary "BitType" option.
               Thus the default is now the "Exact Type" used by
               Binkley 2.55 and newer.
        
             - The "TypeCost" verb has been dropped.
               It was used to differentiate CallCost basing on
               modem type. This way, in a multi-line environment,
               you could make each line call the appropriate modem
               types.
               To achieve the same goal, please use the front-end
               dial string selection options (ModemTrans in Binkley).
        
             - The totally useless "Name" and "Comments" options
               have been dropped.
        
             - The "Gated" config option has been dropped and the
               "GateAddr", "GateCoord" verbs have been replaced by
               "IncAddr", "ExcAddr", "IncCoord".
        
             - The "Interlist" config option has been dropped.
               It is substituted by the "IncSysOp" verb.
        
             - The "Type" and "CM" keywords have been dropped.
               Their functions are more cleanly implemented via
               the "NodeFlags" verb.
        
             - The "TypeDef" statement has been modified to a "table"
               form, for better coherency.
        
             - The addresses in Fidouser.Lst now always have the
               heading zone number, even if it is the same as yours.
        
             - Fixed little bug that could cause some cfg keywords
               not to be recognized unless followed by a comment
        
        
        
        1.16
             - Fixed bug in the Register routine that caused
               some keys not to work (1 every 256).
        
        
        
        1.15
             - Some programs skip the first entry in V6 nodelist,
               assuming it is a dummy entry that contains the version
               number of the nodelist. These programs could loose
               the "zone number" of the first zone compiled, thus
               assuming zone 0.
               Now FastLst puts the "version ID" entry at the start
               of nodelist V6.
        
        
        
        1.14
             - Some programs do not correctly read V7 indices when
               an empty node appears (This happens when a key has no
               greater keys in the lower index level, so that it points
               to an empty node).
               Sometimes these programs could not find part of the
               V7 nodelist entries.
               Now FastLst adds a dummy duplicate key to avoid the problem.
        
             - New "Node,<address>,..." keyword to allow
               straightforwad addition of nodes without the need for
               Zone and Host lines.
        
             - Removed the Point flag in the output nodelist for
               point 0 entries (after the "Boss,..." keyword).
        
        
        
        1.13
             - When a totally empty line was found in a nodelist
               file a strange undesired nodelist entry was compiled.
               It was not a bug since FTS-0005 does not allow
               empty nodelist lines, however it has been fixed
               to avoid problems with private manually written
               nodelist segments.
        
             - The .DOC now reports an "undocumented" feature:
               when using the "Boss,<address>" method for pointlists,
               you can also use the point #0 to easily add the Boss
               entry, if useful.
        
        
        
        1.12
             - In the case of SysOps of multiple nodes, all the
               Name/Address couples are now put in the SysOp
               lists (fidouser.lst and sysop.ndx).
                 This new behaviour allows to use the great "address
               choice" feature of TimEd (excellent Dos/OS2 message
               editor by Gerard van Essen 2:281/527).
        
             - New behaviour of "SysDup" option: since now all the
               name-duplicate sysop entries are kept by default,
               SysDup allows to keep (for a particular sysop name)
               only the entry with one of the specified addresses.
        
             - Many internal changes, not visible to users: if you
               find out a new unexpected behaviour, please let me
               know.
        
             - Removed redundant empty lines in nodelist.prn and
               nodelist.txt after comment lines.
        
        
        
        1.11
             - CRC is now checked on all nodelist files that have
               the expected CRC on the first line (previously it
               was checked when applying nodediffs only).
        
             - New errorlevel 10 for CRC Error while compiling
               nodelist (errorlevel 9 is still used for CRC Error
               while applying nodediff).
        
             - When merging the first line is skipped if it contains
               the CRC.
        
             - New -r command line switch to avoid exit on CRC Error.
        
             - New -s command line switch to override SYSOP.NDX
               base name.
        
             - Any file specification can contain drive and path,
               including -n -d -o -s overrides.
        
             - When using Version7 only, the added nodelist segments
               are appended to the end of the full main nodelist
               instead of the end of your zone.
        
             - Some small changes in Nodelist.Prn and Nodelist.Txt
        
             - Fixed bug introduced in v 1.10: when a region segment
               (no zone entry) was compiled as the main nodelist,
               zone 0 was erroneously assumed.
               Now the address levels not present in the main nodelist
               correctly default to the config address.
        
        
        
        1.10
             - OS/2: First 32 bit version, compiled by BC++.
        
             - OS/2: New "flat" index sorting (no more disk based
               merge-sort).
        
             - OS/2: "TmpPath" option in *.cfg not used any more.
        
             - OS/2: Long filename support
        
             - DOS: The "TmpPath" directory is now automatically
               created when necessary.
        
             - New improved Disk Full handling (errorlevel 4)
        
             - New "-o<nodebase>" command line switch to override
               output file names (NODEX.* -> <nodebase>.*).
        
             - New "KillAfter" config verb, to save old nodelist files
               in the case of compilation error.
        
             - New "Boss <address>" statement for easier pointlist
               support (see FastLst.DOC).
        
             - New optional partial address parameter in
               "MyList <nodefile> [default partial address]"
               to allow the addition of nodelist segments without
               the need of ZONE, HOST, node prefix lines (V7 only).
               See FastLst.DOC for more details.
        
             - New "-i<include>" command line switch to allow easier
               different file inclusions.
        
             - New "KillOld" config statement to kill old versions of
               nodelist files.
        
             - New "Kill999" config statement to kill the .999 file
               that remains after merging with MergeList.
        
             - Now the .999 file is killed whenever FastLst begins
               execution, thus you do not have to manually delete it
               if you stop using the MergeList command.
        
             - Now the "Gated" config keyword prevents Hub coordinators
               of other zones to be put in the output nodelist (only
               ZC and NC remain).
        
             - New "GateAddr" config keyword allows to have only
               selected zones, regions and nets in the output files.
        
             - New "GateCoord" config keyword allows to have in the
               output files only selected coordinators from the excluded
               zones, regions and nets.
        
             - New errorlevel 9 exit after CRC error while applying
               a nodediff. If "Autoerase" is active, the nodediff and
               the resulting nodelist files are erased, otherwise they
               are renamed to NODEDIFF.BAD and NODELIST.BAD.
        
             - New "StatusLog" config statement to specify the log
               filename in the .cfg instead of the command line.
        
             - New "TypeExact" config option to set modem types in a
               way more coherent with the behaviour of Binkley 2.55 and
               newer.
        
             - New "SysDup" config option to override FastLst's choice
               when killing duplicate SysOp Names.
        
        
        
        1.06
             - OS/2: Fixed bug that caused some reg. keys not to work.
        
             - DOS: Fixed bug that sometimes caused memory problems
               during index sorting.
        
        
        
        1.05
             - New UCOST verbs to set User Cost Different from Call Cost.
        
             - OS/2: Fixed bug that sometimes caused "Disk Full" error.
        
        
        
        1.04
             - Changed redirection criteria: if you have a password with a
               hold/unpublished system or its coordinator, then it is NOT
               redirected; instead it gets an empty phone number string.
        
             - Slightly changed the algorithm to choose the entry for
               a multi-SysOp in Sysop.Ndx, so that he never gets data from
               an entry that is not used due to local segment override.
        
             - Added "Flags" Keyword to set the user defined bits.
        
             - OS/2: Fixed a bug that caused a "NULL POINTER" error when
               compiling only Version 6 and FidoUserLst.
        
        
        
        1.03
             - Added <CR> before comment output to fix video output when
               both comments and report are active, Thanks to Roberto
               Zanasi.
        
             - OS/2: First (16 bit) version, ported by Pasquale Cantiello.
        
        
        
        1.02
             - Null pointer bug fixed in Merge module, Thanks to Pasquale
               Cantiello.
        
        
        
        1.01
             - Minor message and DOC adjusting.
        
        
        
        1.00
             - First public release.
