Per Lundberg:

This is fastlst/aplibs for Linux. I've just made it compile cleanly on my
system (it uses autoconf/automake, but it doesn't really care about what it
discovers). Since I didn't have any need for any of the other platforms, I've
removed much of the OS/2/DOS/Win32-portability stuff. Porting to other Unixy
platforms is probably quite simple, and your patches are welcome. See the file
AUTHORS for contact information.
