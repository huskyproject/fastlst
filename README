Husky users: Do ***NOT*** run configure in the main directory of this
distribution. Change into the "makefls" subdirectory and run "gmake all
install" there without having run configure before

For technical reasons, for this package the "Husky" makefile
is in the "makefls" subdirectory instead of in the main directory.


Per Lundberg:

This is fastlst/aplibs for Linux. I've just made it compile cleanly on my
system (it uses autoconf/automake, but it doesn't really care about what it
discovers). Since I didn't have any need for any of the other platforms, I've
removed much of the OS/2/DOS/Win32-portability stuff. Porting to other Unixy
platforms is probably quite simple, and your patches are welcome. See the file
AUTHORS for contact information.
