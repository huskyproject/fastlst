This program (fastlst) and this library (aplibs) was originally written by
Alberto Pasquale. See the file fastlst/COPYING and aplibs/COPYING for more
information about this.

The conversion to Linux and autoconf/automake was solemnly done by
Per Lundberg. Please do NOT mail questions/whatever about this to Alberto,
but to me. My E-mail address is plundis@debian.org.
