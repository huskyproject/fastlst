Change in Licensing conditions for ApWorks Fidonet Software

More than 4 years have elapsed since I released the source code of 
my fidonet software.

I am very happy that my work is still useful to many people.

In order to permit an easier sharing, I am lifting some licensing 
conditions.

Effective today, all the source code published in 
ftp://ftp.apworks.com/apbbssrc/ is subject to the new licensing 
terms you can find in ftp://ftp.apworks.com/apbbssrc/LICENSE.txt

Enjoy !
